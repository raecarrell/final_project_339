                <p>Desserts are an integral part of Spanish cuisine. Crema Catalana, Arroz con Leche, and Tarta de Santiago are some of the most popular desserts in Spain. Crema Catalana is a dessert extremely similar to what many of us know as creme brulee. This creamy chilled dessert is extremely popular during the hot summers of Spain. Arroz con Leche is the Spanish version of a rice pudding. Its popularity initially rose from the sustainability of using leftover rice. The desert is made of rice, milk, water, sugar, and sometimes raisins. Finally, Tarta de Santiago is an extremely popular Spanish dessert often served at celebrations and holidays. It is a scrumptious almond cake that is known for its look. A Tarta de Santiago has the Cross of St. James on top, shaped with the dusting of powdered sugar. Spain has many scrumptious desserts that are a unique part of its culture and history. </p>
